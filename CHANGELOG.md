# Changelog

All notable changes to Islet are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [0.1.0-beta.1] — 2026-07-20

First public beta. 🎉

### Added
- **Now Playing** — detects Apple Music and Spotify playback via AppleScript, with
  album art, metadata, and play/pause/next/previous transport controls. Collapsed notch
  peeks album art and a live audio indicator; auto-opens briefly on track change.
- **Drop Shelf** — drag files onto the notch to stash them, drag them back out anywhere,
  double-click to reveal in Finder. Persists across launches.
- **Clipboard History** — rolling history of copied text and images, click to re-copy,
  with password/transient filtering.
- **Settings** — notch behavior (hover/click, delays, haptics), size & shape (width,
  height, corner radius, closed-height boost), per-display targeting, feature toggles,
  clipboard options, and launch-at-login.
- Menu-bar item with Settings and Quit.
- Works on notchless displays as a floating handle.
- Built-in self-check runner (`swift run IsletChecks`) and swift-testing suite.

### Known limitations
- Ad-hoc signed, **not notarized** — first launch requires right-click → Open (or clearing
  the quarantine attribute).
- Now Playing supports Apple Music and Spotify only (system-wide MediaRemote is gated by
  Apple on recent macOS and intentionally not used).
- Dragging a file *directly* onto a collapsed notch does not auto-open it yet; hover to
  open, then drop. (Tracked for a future release.)
- Requires macOS 14 or later.
